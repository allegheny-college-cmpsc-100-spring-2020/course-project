# CMPSC 100-03: Group Project Presentations

Each group will present their project over the course of the final full week of class. These presentations will be staggered such that (at most) three groups can present on a given day. You will be allowed to choose your presentation date from a list provided below.

## Presentation guidelines

Presentations must:

* Be between 10 and 15 minutes in length
* Relate the overall "story" of the project from intiial idea to present form by:
    * Describing overall program functionality and design
    * Describing group challenges and the strategies used to overcome them
    * Demonstrating project design using a combination of:
        * Live demonstration
        * Design diagrams and documents
        * Other media as deemed necessary
    * Showcasing specific excerpts of code essential to the project by describing and providing practical code review/walkthrough of the selected snippet(s)

## Required deliverables

All presentations and related materials should be uploaded to the `presentations` directory of your repository as `PDF` files.

## Note about presentation

Please be aware that we will have visitors during this time; these visitors may be other students or professors interested in your projects and your approaches/methods. This means that presentations will have some dimension of formality, though I encourage groups to assert their "corporate" personalities in whatever ways are appropriate to your individual group personas and project category.

In short, I expect that you'll dedicate time to planning and executing these presentations but that, above all, you'll show your creative selves as well.
